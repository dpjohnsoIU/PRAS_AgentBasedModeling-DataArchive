The code and accompanying data will run an agent-based expsure model for a 1-year period and calculate daily PM2.5 exposure for several different vulnerable groups. Exposure is calculated using a weekly dataset of PM2.5 concentration over a 250M grid within the Pleasant Run Airshed of Indianapolis, IN. The process for the creation of teh PM 2.5 concentration will be made available here once published, it is currently under review. Also the agent-based manuscript is currenlty under review and will be made available here once published.
